# _**Traffic Red Light Violation Detection**_

_This project aims to detect traffic red light violations using computer vision and machine learning. It employs real-time recognition of traffic light states and identifies vehicles violating red signals._

# _**Features**_

* _Real-Time Traffic Light Detection: Accurately identifies red, yellow, and green lights from video feeds._

* _Violation Detection: Flags vehicles crossing intersections during a red light._

* _License Plate Recognition: Uses OCR to extract license plate numbers of violating vehicles._

# _**Technologies Used**_

**Python Libraries:**

* _OpenCV for image processing_

* _Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR for text recognition_

* _Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn for data visualization_


# _Workflow_

_**Traffic Light Detection:**_

* _Recognizes the state of the traffic light in real-time using OpenCV._

_**Violation Identification:**_

* _Tracks vehicle movement to detect crossings during a red light._

_**OCR Processing:**_

* _Extracts license plate details for identified violators using Tesseract OCR._

# _**Dataset:**_
