# **Traffic Red Light Violation Detection**

_This project aims to detect traffic red light violations using computer vision and machine learning. It employs real-time recognition of traffic light states and identifies vehicles violating red signals._

# **Features**

* _Real-Time Traffic Light Detection: Accurately identifies red, yellow, and green lights from video feeds._

* _Violation Detection: Flags vehicles crossing intersections during a red light._

* _License Plate Recognition: Uses OCR to extract license plate numbers of violating vehicles._

# Technologies Used

**Python Libraries:**

_OpenCV for image processing_

__Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR for text recognition_

_Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn for data visualization_


# Workflow

** Traffic Light Detection:**

Recognizes the state of the traffic light in real-time using OpenCV.

** Violation Identification:**

Tracks vehicle movement to detect crossings during a red light.

** OCR Processing:**

Extracts license plate details for identified violators using Tesseract OCR.
